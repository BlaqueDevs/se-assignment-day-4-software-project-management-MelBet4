## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
-Agile is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes adaptability and continuous feedback. It allows changes throughout development and involves customers regularly. In contrast, Waterfall follows a structured, linear process where each phase is completed before moving to the next, making it ideal for projects with fixed requirements.  

Advantages of Agile:
- Highly adaptable to changes  
- Encourages collaboration and customer feedback  
- Continuous testing improves quality  
- Faster delivery of working software  
Disadvantages of Agile:
- Requires constant client involvement  
- Can lead to scope creep if not managed well  
- Less predictable budget and timeline  

Advantages of Waterfall:
- Well-structured with clear phases  
- Easier to manage for projects with fixed requirements  
- Detailed documentation ensures clarity  
Disadvantages of Waterfall:
- Rigid and difficult to change once development starts  
- Testing happens late, increasing risks  
- Not suitable for dynamic or evolving projects

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial:  
Agile works best for projects with evolving requirements, frequent customer feedback, and the need for flexibility. It suits dynamic environments where rapid changes are expected.  
Examples:
- Software startups: developing new products with changing user needs  
- Mobile app development: requiring regular updates and improvements  
- E-commerce platforms: adapting to user behavior and trends  

When Waterfall is More Beneficial:  
Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, strict regulations, and minimal expected changes. It suits projects where documentation and predictability are crucial.  
Examples:
- Government project: with fixed compliance rules  
- Banking software requiring extensive security and documentation  
- Construction planning where each phase must be completed before moving to the next

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance:

- Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Detects and fixes issues early.  
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Ensures code meets requirements before implementation.  
- Performance Testing – Validates system efficiency under different conditions.  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Ensures software meets customer expectations.  

-Maintaining high standards enhances reliability, user satisfaction, security, and compliance while reducing costly bug fixes and rework. Quality software improves brand reputation and business success.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
-Defining the project scope sets clear boundaries, objectives, and deliverables, preventing scope creep, misalignment, and resource wastage. It ensures better planning, budgeting, and stakeholder expectations management.  
 
-A WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It visually organizes work into structured levels, making planning and execution more efficient.  

Why is WBS Useful?
- Improves task clarity and accountability  
- Helps in resource allocation and scheduling  
- Enhances risk management

Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:
- Ensures timely task completion  
- Improves resource management  
- Helps track progress and identify delays  
- Enhances coordination among team members  
- Reduces risks by setting clear deadlines and dependencies  

How Gantt Charts Assist:
- Visualize task timelines and dependencies  
- Identify overlaps and bottlenecks  
- Help in workload distribution  
- Allow real-time tracking and adjustments  
- Improve communication with stakeholders
